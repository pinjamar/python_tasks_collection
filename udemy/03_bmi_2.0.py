# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2

if int(bmi) <= 18.5:
    print(f"Your bmi is {bmi}, you are underweight!")
elif 18.5 < int(bmi) <= 25:
    print(f"Your bmi is {bmi}, you weight is normal!")
elif 25 < int(bmi) <= 30:
    print(f"Your bmi is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight!")
elif 30 < int(bmi) < 35:
